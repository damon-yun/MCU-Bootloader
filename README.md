# MCU-Bootloader
The MCU bootloader is a configurable flash programming utility that operates over a serial connection on supported NXP MCUs. It enables quick and easy programming through the entire product lifecycle -- from application development to final product manufacturing and beyond -- for updating applications in the field with confidence.

The bootloader is delivered in two ways: as full source code that is highly configurable; or pre-programmed by NXPÂ® into ROM or flash on select NXP MCUs. Host-side command line and GUI tools are available to communicate with the bootloader. The MCU bootloader uses startup, header files, and peripheral drivers from MCUXpresso SDK.

NOTE: This bootloader was previously named Kinetis Bootloader (or KBOOT). It has been renamed to "MCU Bootloader" (or MCUBOOT). The legacy KBOOT downloads are still available on the MCUBOOT downloads tab.
